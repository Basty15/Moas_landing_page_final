        <h1>The Ministry of Altar Servers is group of young servers assisting in the Parish Liturgical and Religious celebrations. Its main goal is
             to encourage young men and women to become worthy guards of honor to the Eucharistic King and to enkindle greater piety and devotion to Christ through 
             the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass.</h1>

    <section id="History">
        <h1>The origins of the altar server's ministry, however, go back to a much earlier period, namely, to the times
             of persecution (before 313). In the early Christian Church, the main duty of an altar server was
             the unceasing guard of a church or a particular relic.Servers are a very ancient tradition in the liturgical experience of the church. In the history of the Church, altar servers were young men who were studying to be priests. That is why the Church said at that time 
             that only boys could be servers, because only men could be priests.</h1>
